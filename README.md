# RNN-and-DNN-from-scratch

This project includes an RNN and a DNN created from scratch. They run over a dataset from kaggle of people saying the numbers 1-50. It pulls the data from the audio files and the number off the file name and then runs the RNN and DNN over the data. It then prints the resulting accuracy for comparison.
